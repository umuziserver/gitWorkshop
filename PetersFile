My name is Peter
I am 27
I like turtles
They have nice shells
They walk nice and slow
I like Coding and Chilling
Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world â€“ beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!
They have a hard shell
They must listen slow too.
I bet they process slow.
I am Thor
