My name is Peter
I am 27
I like turtles
They have nice shells
They walk nice and slow
Turtles are reptiles
My Name is Saida not Peter
Im the Master when it comes to coding
I'm rich because I earn stippend
Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world â€“ beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!
They have a hard shell
They must listen slow too.
I bet they process slow.
