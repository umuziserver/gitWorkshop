My name is Peter
I like turtles
They have nice shells
They walk nice and slow
Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world – beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!
They have a hard shell
They must listen slow too. 
I bet they process slow.
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
